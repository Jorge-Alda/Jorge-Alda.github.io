Hi, I am Jorge Alda, and this is my personal webpage!

I was born in Calatayud (Zaragoza, Spain) in 1993. I'm currently finalishing my PhD studies in theoretical Physics at the University of Zaragoza. My previous studies are:

* B.Sc. in Physics, University of Zaragoza.
* M.Sc in Theoretical Physics, Universidad Complutense de Madrid.
* Research stay in Universit√† degli Studi di Padova.

You can check out all the places where I have been to in [my Worldline](worldline.html).

When I'm not busy uncovering the structure of the universe, my interests also include coding, comic books and movies, RPG videogames and languages.
