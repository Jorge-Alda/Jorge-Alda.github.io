## Work environement

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the extension
[LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop). Most modern TeX
processors have similar capabilities (syntax detection, bracket matching,
synctex between source and pdf,...), but I prefer VSCode because I can use
one program for everything.

As the TeX distribution I use TeXlive. If you're on Ubuntu, like me, make sure
to not install texlive using `apt`, as that version will probably be very
outdated. See for example [this guide](https://fahim-sikder.github.io/post/installing-texlive-latest-ubuntu/) for how to install the right version.

## Project structure

The LaTeX project files should live in their own directory, with no code or anything else.
The directory should correspond to its own git repo.

The base directory should only contain LaTeX source files (`.tex`, `.bib`, `.sty` or `.cls`),
and the configuration files for git and GitHub. Figures & cia should be organized
in folder(s). The products of LaTeX's compilation, including `.pdf` files, shouldn't
be tracked by git. This is achieved by a `.gitignore` file in the base directory:

```gitignore
*.pdf
!figures/*.pdf
*.aux
*.log
*.out
*.bbl
```

The first line excludes all `.pdf` files in the repo, but the second line makes an
exception for the `.pdf` files in the `figures` folder (should add a similar
exception for each folder). The rest of the lines exclude some of the usual files
produced by the compilation. There are many more, depending on your packages and
editor, so make sure to add all of them.

The plots generated by `matplotlib` or other plotting packages should be saved, if
possible, as `.pgf` files, which is a TeX graphic format that can be used by
including `\usepackage{pgf}` at the preamble of the main file, and then

```latex
\resizebox{0.45\textwidth}{!}{\input{figures/myplot.pgf}}
```

where you want to insert the plot. For certain plots, for example scatter plots
with many points, a `.pgf` takes too much to compile. In those cases, if possible,
use a `.pdf`. Non-vectorial formats like `.png` or `jpg` should be the last option.

For projects with non-`.pgf` images, it is recommended to use [git lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs).
This tool makes easier for git and GitHub to manage large files, and doesn't
modify your local copy. Once installed, run the following command

```bash
git lfs track "*.pdf"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```

Every file with those extensions will be managed by LFS, and you don't have to do
anything else. The LFS settings are stored in a `.gitattributes` file.

## Subfiles

For large projects, it's better to keep each chapter or section in a separate file.
The package `subfiles` allows for the compilation of both the whole document and
each individual chapter file, inheriting the preamble of the parent file.

In the parent file, add `\usepackage{subfiles}` in the preamble, and
`\subfile{mychapter.tex}` wherever you want to insert the chapter. In the chapter
files, start with `\documentclass[myparent.tex]{subfiles}`, and write
`\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` around your TeX code as usual. Chapter
files don't need a preamble before `\begin{document}`, they use the same as its
parent. Now you can compile the parent file to get the complete document, or
each chapter individually.

If you want some part of the text to be different depending on the file being
compiled as the whole document or as a standalone chapter, use the command

```latex
\ifSubfilesClassLoaded{
    This text is only visible when compiled as an individual chapter.
}{
    This text is only visible when compiled as the whole document.
}
```

This is useful, for example, if you want to include the bibliography at the end
of individual chapters.

## Packages and newcommands

I personally prefer having all the `\usepackage`'s at the preamble of the main file.
Another option is to collect them in a `mypackages.sty` file, and then load them with
a single `\usepackage{mypackages}` at the preamble. In any case, each package has to
be followed by a %-comment with a brief description, in order to make sure that the
package is needed.

`\newcommand`'s are very useful to define common complex combinations. They should never
be used to re-define primitive LaTeX commands (for example, don't define `\be` and
`\ee` to redefine `\begin{equation}` and `\end{equation}`, it reduces legibility and
you can achieve a similar performance using autocompletion in you editor).

Commands should be defined in a `mycommands.sty` file (or even better, in several
`.sty` files), and loaded with `\usepackage{mycommands}`. Also, if possible, document
them with %-comments.
