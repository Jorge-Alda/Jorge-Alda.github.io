*Abstract:*
We analyse the new physics implications of theoretically clean $b \to s$ observables in a model-independent approach and compare their coherence with the implications of other rare $B$-decays. A statistical comparison is done between the New Physics explanation and hadronic contributions as the source of the anomalies in angular observables of the $B\to K^*\mu\mu$ decay. We make projections for future measurements that indicate that LHCb will be in the position to discover lepton non-universality via a single observable using the Run 3 data. The global fit of rare $B$-decays is given within a multidimensional fit involving all the 20 relevant Wilson coefficients.
