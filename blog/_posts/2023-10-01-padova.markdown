Today I'm starting a two-year postdoc at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova, in northern Italy. I will be working on axions and ALPs, but also flavour stuff. I will try to keep the blog updated.

By the way, in my [Fediscience account](https://fediscience.org/@jalda), I'm selecting some interesting arXiv preprints every day. Check it out!

Ciao da Padova!
