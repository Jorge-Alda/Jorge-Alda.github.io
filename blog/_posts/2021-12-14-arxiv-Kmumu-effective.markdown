*Abstract:*
We analyze the New Physics sensitivity of a recently proposed method to measure the CP-violating \\(\{\\cal B\}(K\_S\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)\_\{\\ell=0\}\\) decay rate using \\(K_S - K_L\\) interference. We present our findings both in a model-independent EFT approach as well as within several simple NP scenarios. We discuss the relation with associated observables, most notably \\({\\cal B}(K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu)\\). We find that simple NP models can significantly enhance \\({\\cal B}(K_S\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)_{\\ell=0}\\), making this mode a very promising probe of physics beyond the standard model in the kaon sector.
