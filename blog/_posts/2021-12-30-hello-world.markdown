Welcome to my personal page. I will periodically post any updates here.

You can also check my [Github discussion page](https://github.com/Jorge-Alda/Jorge-Alda/discussions).

## How does it work?

This site is hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Everything you see around here is generated from [this repo](https://github.com/Jorge-Alda/Jorge-Alda.github.io). The posts are (mostly) written in Markdown, and then converted into HTML by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [hydejack template](https://hydejack.com/). Comments in the posts are provided by [giscus](https://giscus.app/es), which uses Github's [discussion system](https://github.com/Jorge-Alda/Jorge-Alda.github.io/discussions). The ["Around the arXiv" posts](/tag-arxiv/) are processed by [this script](https://github.com/Jorge-Alda/arXivMkdwn), which reads [arXiv's API](https://arxiv.org/help/api/basics) and escapes special characters.
