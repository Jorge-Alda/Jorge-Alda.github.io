*Abstract:*
Positivity bounds of higher derivative operators are derived from analyticity, causality and unitarity in effective field theory. We show that the positivity bounds can be derived from the non-negativity of relative entropy between a theory with and without interactions between heavy and light degrees of freedom. We prove that the interactions increase thermodynamic entropy at fixed energy and charge, which implies the extremality relations of a wide class of black holes exhibiting Weak-Gravity-Conjecture-like behavior. As the entropy constraint is a consequence of Hermiticity of Hamiltonian operator, any UV theory violating the entropy constraint would not respect the second law of the thermodynamics.
