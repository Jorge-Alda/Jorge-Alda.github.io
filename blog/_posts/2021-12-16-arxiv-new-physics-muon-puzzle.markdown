*Abstract:*
 The recent measurement of the muon \\(g\\)-2 at Fermilab confirms the previous Brookhaven result. The leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon \\(g\\)-2 represents a crucial ingredient to establish if the Standard Model prediction differs from the experimental value. A recent lattice QCD result by the BMW collaboration shows a tension with the low-energy \\(e^+e^- \\to \\text{hadrons}\\) data which are currently used to determine the HVP contribution. We refer to this tension as the new muon \\(g\\)-2 puzzle. In this Letter we consider the possibility that new physics contaminates the experimental extraction of the \\(e^+e^- \\to \\text{hadrons}\\) cross-section. This scenario could, in principle, solve the new muon \\(g\\)-2 puzzle. However, we show that this solution is excluded by a number of experimental constraints.
