*Abstract:*
We investigate the subleading-power corrections to the exclusive $B\to D \ell \nu_\ell$ form factors at ${\cal O} (\alpha_s^0)$ in the light-cone sum rules (LCSR) framework by including the two- and three-particle higher-twist contributions from the $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes up to the twist-six accuracy, by taking into account the subleading terms in expanding the hard-collinear charm-quark propagator, and by evaluating the hadronic matrix element of the subleading effective current $\bar q \, \gamma_{\mu} \, i \not\!\!{D}_\perp / (2 \, m_b) \, h_v$. Employing further the available leading-power results for the semileptonic $B \to D$ form factors at the next-to-leading-logarithmic level and combining our improved LCSR predictions with the recent lattice determinations, we then carry out a comprehensive phenomenological analysis on the semi-leptonic $B\to D \ell \nu_\ell$ decay. We extract $|V_{cb}| = \big(40.3^{+0.9}_{-0.8} {\big |_{\rm th}}\,\, {}^{+1.4}_{-1.4} {\big |_{\rm exp}} \big) \times 10^{-3}$ ($|V_{cb}| = \big(41.0^{+0.9}_{-0.8} {\big |_{\rm th}}\,\, {}^{+1.0}_{-1.0} {\big |_{\rm exp}} \big) \times 10^{-3}$) using the BaBar (Belle) experimental data, and particularly obtain for the gold-plated ratio $R(D) = 0.305 \pm 0.007$.
