*Abstract:*
We perform a model-independent global fit to all \\(b \\to s \\ell \\ell\\) data in the light of recent measurements of the lepton flavour universality violating (LFUV) observables \\(R\_\{K\_S^0\}\\) and \\(R\_\{K^\{\*+\}\}\\) as well as the updated measurements of observables in \\(B\_s \\to \\phi \\mu^+ \\mu^-\\) decay, by the LHCb collaboration. We obtain new physics (NP) solutions to the current anomalies in the data, assuming NP in the muon sector only. We find that the 1D NP scenarios \\(C\_9^\{\\rm NP\} <0 \\) and \\(C\_\{9\}^\{\\rm NP\}=-C\_\{10\}^\{\\rm NP\}\\) continue to be the most favoured ones. However, the significance of the then favoured scenario \\(C\_\{9\}^\{\\rm NP\}=-C'\_\{9\}\\) has reduced and the updated data now marginally prefers \\(C\_\{10\}^\{\\rm NP\}\\) scenario over \\(C\_\{9\}^\{\\rm NP\}=-C'\_\{9\}\\). The 2D scenarios \\((C\_9^\{\\rm NP\}, C\_\{10\}^\{\\prime\} )\\), \\((C\_9^\{\\rm NP\}, C\_\{9\}^\{\\prime\} )\\) and \\((C\_9^\{\\rm NP\}, C\_\{10\}^\{\\rm NP\} )\\), continue to be favoured by the data in the listed order. We also analyse generic TeV scale \\(Z'\\) models which can generate the favored 1D scenarios, \\(C\_9^\{\\rm NP\} \\) and \\(C\_9^\{\\rm NP\} = -C\_\{10\}^\{\\rm NP\}\\) along with the 2D NP scenarios \\((C\_9^\{\\rm NP\}, C\_\{9\}^\{\\prime\} )\\) and \\((C\_9^\{\\rm NP\}, C\_\{10\}^\{\\rm NP\} )\\). Using the additional constraints from \\(B\_s -\\bar\{B\_s\}\\) mixing and neutrino trident data, we find that all four models provide an equally good fit to the data. Further, we consider a model with a 25 MeV \\(Z'\\) that couples to muons and has a \\(q^2\\) dependent \\(b - s\\) coupling. We also study the implications of the current data on the LFUV observable \\(R\_\{\\phi\}\\), \\(Q\_\{4,5\}\\) along with \\(R\_\{K^\{(\*)\}\}\\) in the high \\(q^2\\). We find that a precise measurements of these observables can provide a good discrimination between a few favored model-independent solutions, and have a potential to disentangle different heavy and light \\(Z'\\) scenarios considered in this work.
