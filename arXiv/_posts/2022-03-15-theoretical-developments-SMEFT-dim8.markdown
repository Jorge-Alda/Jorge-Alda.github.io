*Abstract:*
In this contribution to the Snowmass 2021 process we review theoretical developments in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) with a focus on effects at the dimension-8 level and beyond. We review the theoretical advances that led to the complete construction of the operator bases for the dimension-8 and dimension-9 SMEFT Lagrangians. We discuss the possibility of obtaining all-orders results in the \\(1/\\Lambda\\) expansion for certain SMEFT observables, and briefly present the on-shell approach to constructing SMEFT amplitudes. Finally we present several new phenomenological effects that first arise at dimension-8 and discuss the impact of these terms on experimental analyses.
