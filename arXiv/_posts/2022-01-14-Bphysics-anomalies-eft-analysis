*Abstract:*
We discuss some theoretical aspects related to the \\(B\\)-anomalies, both for the neutral current and the charged current anomalies. A possible combined explanation within an EFT framework as well as an explicit simplified model featuring the \\(U\_1\\) leptoquark are discussed. The model gives rise to predictions in other sectors that are experimentally accessible within the next few years.
