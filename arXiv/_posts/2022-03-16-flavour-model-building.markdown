*Abstract:*
In this white paper for the Snowmass process, we summarize the role flavor model building plays in the quest for new physics. We review approaches to address the non-generic flavor structure of the Standard Model and discuss how new physics models can be made compatible with the stringent constraints from flavor changing processes that indirectly probe very high scales. We also give an overview of the persistent anomalies in B decays and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and some of their most popular new physics explanations.
