*Abstract:*
This course on Feynman integrals starts from the basics, requiring only knowledge from special relativity and undergraduate mathematics. Topics from quantum field theory and advanced mathematics are introduced as they are needed. The course covers modern developments in the field of Feynman integrals. Topics included in this course are: Representations of Feynman integrals, integration-by-parts, differential equations, intersection theory, multiple polylogarithms, Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky systems, coactions and symbols, cluster algebras, elliptic Feynman integrals, motives associated to Feynman integrals.
