*Abstract:*
Discrepancies between recent experimental results and their respective Standard Model predictions, known as flavour anomalies, are reported in semileptonic charged and neutral-current \\(B\\)-decays, the muon magnetic moment \\((g-2)\_\\mu\\), and the extraction of the Cabibbo angle. In this proceedings, we review two New Physics models that introduce two scalar mediators at the TeV scale and aim at a combined explanation of the flavour anomalies. The first model features the leptoquarks \\(S\_1\\) and \\(S\_3\\) and provides tree level solutions to both \\(B\\)-anomalies and one-loop level solution to the anomalous \\((g-2)\_\\mu\\). The second features the leptoquark \\(S\_1\\) and the charged singlet \\(\\phi^+\\). While \\(S\_1\\) provides the same solution to the charged-current \\(B\\)-anomaly and \\((g-2)\_\\mu\\) as in the first model, \\(\\phi^+\\) can accommodate the Cabibbo-angle anomaly independently and together with \\(S\_1\\) can resolve the neutral-current \\(B\\)-anomaly at one-loop.
