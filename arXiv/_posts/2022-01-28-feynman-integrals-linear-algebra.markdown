*Abstract:*
We find surprisingly that all Feynman integrals (FIs), with any number of loops, can be determined without doing integration. The only needed information are linear relations between FIs. Therefore, FIs computation is conceptually changed to a linear algebraic problem. Examples up to 5 loops are given to verify our observation.
