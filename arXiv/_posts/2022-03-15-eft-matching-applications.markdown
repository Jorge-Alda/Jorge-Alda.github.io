*Abstract:*
Mapping UV theories onto low energy effective descriptions is a procedure known as matching. The last decade has seen tremendous progress in the development of new tools for efficiently performing matching calculations, by relying on so-called functional methods. This white paper summarizes the status of functional matching. Specifically, matching for relativistic theories is a fully solved problem up to one-loop order in perturbation theory, and to arbitrary order in the effective field theory expansion. A streamlined prescription that has been partially automated facilitates the application of functional matching to phenomenological studies in the Standard Model EFT framework.
