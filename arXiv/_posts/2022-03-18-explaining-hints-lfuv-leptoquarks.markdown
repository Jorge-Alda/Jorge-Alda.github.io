*Abstract:*
Leptoquarks are prime candidates for explaining the intriguing hints for lepton flavour universality violation. In particular, the \\(SU(2)\_L\\) doublet of scalar leptoquarks \\(S\_2\\) is capable of providing an explanation for the tensions between the measurements and the Standard Model predictions in \\((g-2)\_\\mu\\), \\(b\\to s\\ell^+ \\ell^-\\) and \\(b\\to c\\tau\\nu\\) processes, as well as in non-resonant di-electron production. However, in the minimal setup with a single leptoquark generation, a common explanation for all these issues is not possible as this would lead to unacceptably large charged lepton flavour violation. We therefore propose a model with three generations of \\(S\_2\\), each coupling exclusively to a single lepton flavour, \textit{i.e.}~a model extending the Standard Model particle content by an electroquark, a muoquark and a tauquark. We show that after taking into account other constraints, such as those originating from electroweak precision observables and \\(\\Delta F=2\\) processes, it is possible to provide a combined explanation for all these hints of lepton flavour universality violation. Moreover, we find that the presence of the tauquark can generate a dimension-six \\(\{\\cal O\}\_9^U\\) operator via off-shell photon penguin diagrams, which, together with the muoquark contribution, further improves the global fit to \\(b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-\\) data.
