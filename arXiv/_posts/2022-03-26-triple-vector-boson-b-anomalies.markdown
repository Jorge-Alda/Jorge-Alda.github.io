*Abstract:*
The triplet vector boson (TVB) is a simplified new physics model involving massive vector bosons transforming as a weak triplet vector, which it has been proposed as a combined explanation to the anomalous \\(b \\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-\\) and \\(b \\to c \\tau\\bar\{\\nu\}\_\\tau\\) data (the so-called \\(B\\) meson anomalies). In this work, we carry out an updated view of the TVB model, including the Belle II perspectives. We perform a global fit to explore the allowed parameter space by the most current \\(b \\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-\\) and \\(b \\to c \\tau\\bar\{\\nu\}\_\\tau\\) data, by considering all relevant low-energy flavor observables. Our results are confronted with the most recent LHC constraints. We also incorporate in our study the first measurement on the ratio \\(R(\\Lambda\_c) = \{\\rm BR\}(\\Lambda\_b \\to \\Lambda\_c\\tau\\bar\{\\nu\}\_\\tau)/\{\\rm BR\}(\\Lambda\_b \\to \\Lambda\_c\\mu\\bar\{\\nu\}\_\\mu)\\) very recently obtained by LHCb. In particular, we show that the TVB model can provide an explanation to the \\(B\\) meson anomalies; however, this framework is in strong tension with LHC bounds. In respect to future flavor measurements at Belle II, our results suggest that a small new physics window would be allow to solely explain the \\(b \\to c \\tau \\bar\{\\nu\}\_\\tau\\) data in agreement with LHC constraints. Furthermore, the implications of our phenomenological analysis of the TVB model to some known flavor parametrizations are also discussed.
