*Abstract:*
We perform a global fit of electroweak data within the Standard Model, using state-of-the art experimental and theoretical results, including a determination of the electromagnetic coupling at the electroweak scale based on recent lattice calculations. In addition to the posteriors for all parameters and observables obtained from the global fit, we present indirect determinations for all parameters and predictions for all observables. Furthermore, we present full predictions, obtained using only the experimental information on Standard Model parameters, and a fully indirect determination of Standard Model parameters using only experimental information on electroweak data. Finally, we discuss in detail the compatibility of experimental data with the Standard Model and find a global p-value of 0.5.
