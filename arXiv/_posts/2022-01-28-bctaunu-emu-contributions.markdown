*Abstract:*
The \\(R(D^\{(\*)\})\\) puzzle stands for a \\(\\sim3\\sigma\\) violation of lepton flavor universality between the decay rates of \\(B\\to D^\{(\*)\}\\tau\\nu\\) and \\(B\\to D^\{(\*)\}\\ell\\nu\\), where \\(\\ell=e,\\mu\\). If it is accounted for by new physics, there is no reason in general that the relevant neutrinos are, respectively, \\(\\nu\_\\tau\\) and \\(\\nu\_\\ell\\). We study whether the \\(\\tau\\) related rate could be enhanced by significant contributions from \\(B\\to D^\{(\*)\}\\tau\\nu\_\\ell\\). We find the upper bounds from forbidden or rare meson decays imply that the contributions from the lepton flavor violating processes account for no more than about \\(4\\%\\) of the required shift. Yet, no fine-tuned flavor alignment is required for the new physics. Searching for the related high-\\(p\_T\\) process \\(pp\\to\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp\\) can at present put a lower bound on the scale of the lepton flavor violating new physics that is a factor of \\(2.2\\) weaker than the bound from meson decays.
