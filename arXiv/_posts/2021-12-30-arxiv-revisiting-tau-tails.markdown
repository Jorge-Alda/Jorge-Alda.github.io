*Abstract:*
We revisit the constraints on semileptonic operators derived from the mono-\\(\\tau\\) high-\\(p_T\\) events in \\(pp\\) collisions at LHC. Like in previous studies, we obtain limits on the New Physics couplings from the CMS data much stronger than from the ATLAS data, despite a nearly equal integrated luminosity. We find that a neglected systematics on the \\(\\tau\\) lepton reconstruction efficiency can partly explain that difference. We then provide new limits on the New Physics couplings relevant to decays based on \\(b\\to c\\tau\\bar{\\nu}\\) by using the recent ATLAS data with 139 \\({\\rm fb}^{-1}\\). We also show that the inclusion of propagation of the New Physics particle can significantly worsen the bounds obtained by relying on Effective Field Theoretical treatment of New Physics.
