*Abstract:*
We proposed a recipe to systematically calculate Feynman integrals containing linear propagators using the auxiliary mass flow method. The key of the recipe is to introduce an quadratic term for each linear propagator and then using differential equations to get rid of their effects. As an application, we calculated all master integrals of vacuum integrals containing a gauge link up to 4 loops, and we checked the results by nontrivial dimensional recurrence relations.
