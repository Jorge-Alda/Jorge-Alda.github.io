*Abstract:*
I detail an optimistic future vision for the use of SMEFT at high-energy colliders, and describe the use of the studies which could result for interpretation of future models. I also explore some of the potential pitfalls which could significantly degrade the utility of those results and discuss approaches to avoid them and ensure that results are actually accurate when applied to new models.
