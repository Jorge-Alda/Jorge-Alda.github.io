*Abstract:*
We investigate matching conditions and threshold corrections between full and effective theories based on the type I seesaw mechanism. In general, using an intuitive Feynman diagrammatical approach, we compute the amplitudes before and after integrating out heavy right-handed neutrinos at the matching scale. In particular, we derive the one-loop matching conditions between the full and the effective theories. The matching conditions of the parameters are influenced by one-loop corrections to the corresponding vertices as well as wave function corrections for the Higgs and the lepton fields. Our results are comparable to earlier results based on a functional approach.
