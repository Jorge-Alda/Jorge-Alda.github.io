*Abstract:*
Using the functional method, one-loop matching of the type-I, -II and -III seesaw models are investigated and the results are presented in both the Green's and the Warsaw bases. Although these models generate the same dimension-5 Weinberg operator, they could induce quite different types of dimension-6 effective operators that can be utilized for model discrimination. We also find the threshold effects from one-loop matching could be significant, which turn out to allow triggering electroweak symmetry breaking radiatively in type-II seesaw while forbid that in type-I/-III models. An analytical criterion for such radiative symmetry breaking is also derived in type-II seesaw. Finally, we investigate the indirect signatures from different types of dimension-6 operators at high-energy colliders, low-energy precision experiments and forward physics facilities for model discrimination.
